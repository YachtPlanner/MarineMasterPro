ABOUT ROUTE PLANNER

How it works:
You set the route points: departure port, destination, and intermediate points with a simple click on the map. The system automatically calculates the key parameters of your passage.

Features:

Integrated Objects Database:
The application loads and displays an extensive database of objects on the map: marinas, ports, anchorages, navigational marks (the actual database is loaded from OpenSeaMap).
For each object, the available information from the database is displayed: type, operator, available fuel, services.

Intelligent Route Calculation:
The program doesn't just calculate straight-line distance; it estimates travel time based on your yacht's specs (length, cruise speed, fuel consumption).
The algorithm uses wind forecast data to calculate a resistance correction factor and determines a conditional difficulty level for the passage.

Weather Data:
For a selected point, the system fetches the current marine forecast, including data on wind, water temperature, and tides.

Simple Interface:
I tried my best to make the interface as intuitive as possible. All basic actions – search, selecting points, viewing data – are done in just a few clicks.
